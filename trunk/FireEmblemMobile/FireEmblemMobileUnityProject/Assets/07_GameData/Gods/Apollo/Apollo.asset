    <Name>k__BackingField: Apollo God of Arts & Healing
    <Description>k__BackingField: 'Apollo, the radiant son of Zeus and Leto, was
      born on the floating island of Delos. From the moment of his birth, he was
      destined for greatness. As a child, Apollo was gifted with a golden lyre by
      Hermes, and with it, he brought music and joy to the halls of Olympus. His
      twin sister, Artemis, and he shared a bond that was unparalleled, often wandering
      the mortal realms together, observing and interacting with humans. They would
      enjoy composing with them, and found humans to be amusingly creative beings.

      Growing
      up, Apollo was not just content with the arts; he sought knowledge and understanding.
      The young god believed that wisdom was the greatest asset any being could have,
      and that earthly pursuits should all culminate in the pursuit of wisdom. He
      established the Oracle of Delphi, a place where mortals could seek divine guidance.
      His dedication to healing and the arts made him a beacon of hope for many,
      a god who bridged the gap between the divine and the mortal.
