    <Name>k__BackingField: Hermes God of Travelors
    <Description>k__BackingField: "Born to Zeus and the nymph Maia, Hermes was quick
      both in mind and body from the very start. As a child, he was known to play
      pranks on gods and mortals alike, using his speed and wit to outmaneuver any
      who sought to catch him. His playful nature was balanced by a deep sense of
      duty, especially when Zeus appointed him as the messenger of the gods. With
      winged sandals on his feet, Hermes traversed between the realms of gods, mortals,
      and even the underworld, ensuring that messages were delivered and that the
      balance between these worlds was maintained.\r"
