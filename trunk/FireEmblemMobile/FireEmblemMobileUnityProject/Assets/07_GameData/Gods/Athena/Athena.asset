    <Name>k__BackingField: Athena Goddess of Wisdom
    <Description>k__BackingField: "Athena's birth was nothing short of miraculous.
      Emerging fully grown and armored from Zeus's forehead, she was a sight to behold.
      But despite her unique genesis, Athena's early years were filled with the same
      curiosity and wonder that any young deity might experience.\r\nGrowing up in
      the grandeur of Mount Olympus, Athena was surrounded by divine wonders and
      celestial mysteries. As a child, she was insatiably curious, always seeking
      to learn and understand the world around her. She would often wander the halls
      of Olympus, listening to the tales of older gods and absorbing their wisdom.\r\nHer
      father, Zeus, recognizing her thirst for knowledge, would often take her to
      the edges of the world, showing her the vastness of the cosmos and the intricate
      tapestry of fate woven by the Moirai. These trips instilled in Athena a profound
      respect for the balance of the universe and the delicate relationship between
      power and responsibility.\r"
