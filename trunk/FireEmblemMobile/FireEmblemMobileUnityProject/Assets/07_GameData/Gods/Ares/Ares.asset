    <Name>k__BackingField: Ares God of War
    <Description>k__BackingField: "Ares, the formidable God of War, was both revered
      and feared. His prowess in battle was unmatched, and he reveled in the chaos
      of war. While many gods preferred strategy and wisdom, Ares was all about raw
      power and aggression. He was regarded as one of the most pivotal and feared
      deities in the pantheon. Both mortals and gods frequently sought his counsel
      on conflict and ardently vied for him to join their side in battle. After all,
      having Ares as an ally was synonymous with assured victory. Or so it was once
      believed.\r"
