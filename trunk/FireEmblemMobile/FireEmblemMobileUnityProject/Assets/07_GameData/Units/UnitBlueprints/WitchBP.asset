    <Name>k__BackingField: Sonia, Witch of Murkwood
    <Description>k__BackingField: 'Nestled deep within the heart of the Eldraine
      woods, where the trees whisper ancient secrets and shadows dance to the tune
      of the wind, Elara''s secluded hut stood. Known to many as the old crone of
      the woods, Elara was a master alchemist and potion maker. Her true age remained
      a mystery, for while she appeared young, her eyes told tales of countless centuries.
      The woods were her realm, and she was its undisputed queen, conjuring curses,
      hexes, and occasionally turning those who dared to cross her into all kinds
      of animals.

      Elara''s mystique spread throughout the neighboring villages,
      and in no time, tales of her enigmatic powers turned her forest into a place
      of legend. Parents would warn their children of the eerie woods, urging them
      to steer clear. Ominous symbols adorned the trees at various entry points,
      serving as chilling reminders for trespassers to think twice before venturing
      further.
