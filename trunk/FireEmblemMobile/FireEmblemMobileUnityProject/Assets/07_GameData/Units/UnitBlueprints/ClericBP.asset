    <Name>k__BackingField: Lysandra, Winged Cleric
    <Description>k__BackingField: 'Lysandra was born under an auspicious star, a
      rare celestial event that marked her as someone special. Her birth was accompanied
      by the miraculous appearance of two pristine white wings on her back. Rumors
      spread that she might be a demigod, possibly a descendant of Hermes, given
      her winged form. However, the truth of her lineage remained a mystery even
      to her. Lysandra''s childhood was marked by dreams of her divine father descending
      from the heavens, taking her away from her humble, dilapidated abode to a realm
      of splendor. These dreams, while a solace from her daily hardships, eventually
      gave way to a growing sense of self-worth and determination. She realized that
      her destiny wasn''t to wait for salvation but to forge her own path.

      Embracing
      her unique gifts, Lysandra transformed from a dreamy-eyed girl to her community''s
      protector. She used her abilities to heal and safeguard her people, becoming
      a beacon of hope. Her once painful past became a source of strength, teaching
      her to value herself for her actions and impact, rather than any divine lineage
      she might possess.
