    <Name>k__BackingField: Dragan, The Emerald Enforcer
    <Description>k__BackingField: "The greek world has moved on from it\u2019s golden
      years, centuries before the demons ever took the land and the seas. The cities
      of Greece became a shadow of their former self, and though many old sould preserved
      to keep the glody of it\u2019s olden days, crime and corruption began to seep
      into the very fabric of society, spreading like a relentless cancer. Among
      these cities, Lysandra, with its grand temples and bustling markets, concealed
      a particularly sinister underbelly. In its labyrinthine alleys and hidden taverns,
      deals are struck, and secrets are traded. It was in this seedy underbelly that
      Dragan's story began. Orphaned at a young age, the streets became both his
      home and his teacher. They taught him the harsh lessons of life, where trust
      was a fleeting shadow, and survival was the only game worth playing.\r"
